            Greetings 👋🏻 I&apos;m Fadad Oussama, a 22-year-old self-taught developer based in the lively city of Casablanca, Morocco{" "}
            <Image src="/flag.png" alt="flag" width={300} height={300} className="inline-block h-[18px] w-[18px]" />. My journey into the realm of
            programming began with a two years of formal education at Ista 🏫, but the real growth in my experience and skills as a developer began
            when I finished my two years at Ista and decided to embark on the path of self learning, this decision made me the developer I always
            dreamed of, because the path of self learning empowers me to confront challenges autonomously, fostering continuous growth through
            learning from mistakes and this exactly what sets great developers apart from their counterparts in the field.
          </p>

          <p>
            Embarking on a new chapter after two years of formal education at Ista 🏫, I decide to start from scratch and build a strong foundation in
            programming by exploring computer science to establish a solid foundation for my ongoing journey. As i later focused on the frontend path
            👨🏻‍💻 navigating through technologies, with a particular focus on those that significantly improve efficiency and boost productivity in my
            workflow.
            <br />

            <span className="text-accent italic">
              As Isaac Asimov wisely said, &quot;Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.&quot;
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Presently, My primary focus lies in the Next.js/React stack ⚛️, a dynamic duo that empowers me to craft user interfaces with unparalleled
            dynamism and performance seamlessly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside the realm of development and learning, you&apos;ll find me immersed in one of two activities. I am either at the gym 🏋🏻‍♂️, dedicated
            to maintaining my physical well-being, or engaged in the world of chess ♟️, providing balance to my life.
